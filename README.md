Data Quality Assurance (DQA) in Research Data Repositories (RDRs)

Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on Data Quality Assurance (DQA) in Research Data Repositories (RDRs). This project focuses on developing a theoretical model and an RDF/OWL ontology for DQA in RDRs.

Abstract
DQA is crucial for the effective sharing and reuse of research data. Despite the extensive literature on research data curation, there is a notable gap in theory-guided exploration of DQA modeling in RDRs. This project addresses this gap by analyzing 12 distinct cases of DQA tools and synthesizing a theoretical model and an ontology that encapsulates DQA theory for RDRs. Our model covers three core DQA activities: evaluation, intervention, and communication. The ontology includes 127 classes, 44 object properties, 7 data properties, and 18 instances, offering a detailed schema for DQA processes.

Features
•	Theoretical Framework: Based on activity theory and data quality literature, providing a structured approach to understanding DQA in RDRs.
•	Ontology Development: A machine processable information artifact, ontology, containing detailed classifications and properties to guide DQA work.

Usage
Refer to the /docs/usage.md file for detailed instructions on using the DQA model and ontology. The documentation includes examples and best practices for integrating the framework into existing RDR workflows.

Contributions
We welcome contributions to enhance and expand the DQA model and ontology. Please refer to the /docs/contributing.md file for guidelines on contributing to the project.
