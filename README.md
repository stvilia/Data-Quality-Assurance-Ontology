# Data Quality Assurance (DQA) Ontology for Research Data Repositories (RDRs)

## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on Data Quality Assurance (DQA) in Research Data Repositories (RDRs). This project focuses on developing a theoretical model and an RDF/OWL ontology for DQA in RDRs.

## Abstract
DQA is crucial for the effective sharing and reuse of research data. Despite the extensive literature on research data curation, there is a notable gap in theory-guided exploration of DQA modeling in RDRs. This project addresses this gap by analyzing 12 distinct cases of DQA tools and synthesizing a theoretical model and an ontology that encapsulates DQA theory for RDRs.

## Features
- **Theoretical Framework**: Based on activity theory and data quality literature, providing a structured approach to understanding DQA in RDRs.
- **Ontology Development**: A machine-processable information artifact ontology containing detailed classifications and properties to guide DQA work.

## Usage
Please refer to our companion paper for detailed guidance on the ontology:

Lee, D.J., Stvilia, B., Gunaydin, F., & Pang, Y. (in press, 2024). Developing a data quality assurance ontology for research data repositories. Journal of Documentation. https://doi.org/10.1108/JD-09-2024-0212.
or directly download the preprint version here:

The paper provides a comprehensive explanation of the data quality assurance ontology, including its development process, potential applicatons, and integration strategies with research data repositories.
