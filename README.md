# Data Quality Assurance (DQA) in Research Data Repositories (RDRs)

## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on Data Quality Assurance (DQA) in Research Data Repositories (RDRs). This project focuses on developing a theoretical model and an RDF/OWL ontology for DQA in RDRs.

## Abstract
DQA is crucial for the effective sharing and reuse of research data. Despite the extensive literature on research data curation, there is a notable gap in theory-guided exploration of DQA modeling in RDRs. This project addresses this gap by analyzing 12 distinct cases of DQA tools and synthesizing a theoretical model and an ontology that encapsulates DQA theory for RDRs.

## Features
- **Theoretical Framework**: Based on activity theory and data quality literature, providing a structured approach to understanding DQA in RDRs.
- **Ontology Development**: A machine-processable information artifact ontology containing detailed classifications and properties to guide DQA work.

## Usage
Refer to the `/docs/usage.md` file for detailed instructions on using the DQA model and ontology. The documentation includes examples and best practices for integrating the framework into existing RDR workflows.
